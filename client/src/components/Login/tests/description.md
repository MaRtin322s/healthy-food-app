# Login Component Functionality Tests

This documentation outlines the functionality tests for the Login component of a React application. These tests are aimed at ensuring that the Login component functions as expected and provides a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- react-router-dom for routing
- AuthContext for user authentication

## Overview

The Login component is a critical part of our application's user authentication flow. It allows users to log in with their credentials, navigate to password reset and registration pages, and submit their login information.

## Code Structure

The code for testing the Login component is organized as follows:

1. **Import Statements**: Import the necessary libraries and components for testing, including React Testing Library, Jest matchers (`@testing-library/jest-dom`), the Login component itself, `AuthContext` for providing authentication context, and `BrowserRouter` for simulating routing.

2. **Mock Context**: Create a mock context to replace the actual `AuthContext` and provide mock functions for user login.

3. **Render Function**: Define a function `renderLoginComponent` to render the Login component within a `BrowserRouter` and wrap it with the `AuthContext.Provider` using the mock context.

4. **Test Suites and Cases**:
   - **Renders the login page main title**: This test case checks if the main title "Login for users" is rendered correctly.
   - **Renders the login page main title**: This test case checks if the "Login Information" section is rendered.
   - **Clicking the link 'Click here' navigates to a password reset page**: This test case simulates clicking the "Click here" link and checks if it navigates to the expected password reset page.
   - **Clicking the link 'Sign Up' navigates to a register page**: This test case simulates clicking the "Sign Up" link and checks if it navigates to the expected registration page.
   - **Login form submits with input values**: This test case simulates filling in login credentials (email and password), clicking the login button, and verifies if the `mockLogin` function is called with the correct input values.

## How to Run the Tests

To run these tests, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

2. Clone the project repository.

3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.

5. Run `npm test` to execute the tests.

## Conclusion

These tests ensure that the Login component behaves as expected, providing a reliable authentication process for users while maintaining the application's overall integrity. By running these tests, we can catch and address any issues that may arise during development and ensure a smooth user experience.
